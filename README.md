# Python-API-Challenge

This is the Readme File for Module 6 Challenge - Python-API-Challenge. The two juypter notebooks are in the WeatherPy folder. Then the output data from WeatherPy is in the Output_data folder. We were advised by our instructor to not include our API_Keys and to not use .gitignore... So I did not include my api_keys and did not include a .gitignore.
